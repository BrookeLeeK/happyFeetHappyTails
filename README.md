## Lessons Learned

This is an outline of one of the first projects I worked on for a client, and the biggest lesson learned here is all of them! Mostly learning how to communicate with a client and executing what they have in mind the best I could, sometimes even better. Overall I'm happy with how this turned out, simple and solid.
